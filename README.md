# Django OpenID Connect Provider

## About OpenID

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which allows computing clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner. Like [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect) for example.
